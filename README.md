# RadiationShieldCalc
Work in progress, Not everything is perfectly organized yet.


## Overview
RadiationShieldCalc is a Python program designed to calculate optimal shielding thickness for diagnostic X-ray rooms. The tool applies physics-based formulas to determine barrier dimensions based on factors such as workload, occupancy, material type, and distance from the radiation source.


## Key Features
- **Interactive input**: Users provide room type, number of patients, barrier material, and occupancy factors.
- **Physics-based calculations**: Computes kerma, transmission, and shielding thickness for primary and secondary barriers.
- **Material database**: Supports multiple materials including lead, concrete, and plaster with predefined attenuation coefficients.
- **Modular Python code**: Functions for calculation steps (kerma, transmission, barrier width) enable easy maintenance and potential expansion.
- **Data-driven design**: Uses structured data tables to store coefficients, workload, and occupancy factors for flexible computations.

## Skills and Approach
- Modular Python programming.
- Handling structured data and interactive user input.
- Translating scientific formulas into computational algorithms.
- Building console-based tools for practical engineering calculations.

This project blends applied physics with software development.
